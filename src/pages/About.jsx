        <h2>ARTIST STATEMENT</h2>
      </div>

      <div className='currpage__body statement'>
        <p>My art practice is leaded by my life experience of being a disabled person in Ukraine. By shedding light on the lives of persons with health issues, I want to bring disabled people into the art world from which we’ve always been excluded.</p>
        <p>Using tools and strategies related to oil painting, digital media and commercial photography I strive to explore the role of stereotypes in the perception of the beauty and sexuality of people with disability. I am looking for the boundaries beyond which we start to be sexually attractive to each other. By creating a conflict between imperfection and attractiveness, I focus on the flaws of the bodies, but place them in an erotic context through angles, colors and environment.</p>
        <p>I work with the oil painting and photography. Working with a photographer, I act as a model using my own body as a medium to express my idea.</p>
