            </div>

            <div className='currpage__body statement'>
                <p>My art practice is based on my experience of being a wheelchair user in post-Soviet society as well as in the UK. By shedding light on the life of a person with a disability, I aim to contribute to the development of inclusivity through the art world.</p>
                <p>My work is autobiographical and inseparable from my everyday life. I use my own body and events from my life as materials for researches. I look for the boundaries beyond which the experience of another person's disability ceases to be something repulsive and begins to seem interesting and appealing.</p>
                <p>Working with tools and strategies related to oil painting, digital media and commercial photography, I explore the role of stereotypes and prejudice in the perception of people with disabilities. In particular, I am interested in how societal and cultural factors influence this perception.</p>
