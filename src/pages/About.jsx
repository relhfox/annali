            </div>

            <div className='currpage__body statement'>
                <p>I’m an artist from Odesa, Ukraine, living in the UK. My practice explores the aesthetics and politics of disabled embodiment, drawing on my lived experience as a female wheelchair user and my background in both academic painting and post-Soviet Ukrainian conceptualism.</p>
                <p>I work across oil painting, video performance, digital media, and social interventions. My work often begins with my own body as a site of inquiry, resistance, and aesthetic experimentation. I position disability as a cultural lens and generative force that reshapes how we imagine beauty, intimacy, and agency.</p>
                <p>Visually and conceptually, I operate at the intersection of conceptual art, relational aesthetics, and figurative painting. I see myself in dialogue with the legacy of Odesa conceptualism, particularly its strategies of irony, language play, and critical distance. However, I diverge by foregrounding the non-normative body as an expressive, political subject, bringing emotional exposure and vulnerability into what was once largely cerebral.</p>
