                <p>In my latest performances I started to focus on my body as an instrument of art process. It occurred to me that I can use it to say something important about being disabled. I do short performances outside. I sit in my powered wheelchair and turn around during the time my camera can shoot in one piece.</p>
                <p>I do this simple, cyclical, and abstract movement in order to express my feelings of alienation and monotony of being disabled in every day life.</p>
                <p>Making “16 and a half” project, I don’t set any goals or plan any scenario. I just come to the spot I chose in advance and start to tern around. Each performance is open for contingencies as well as different interpretations.</p>
                <p>Before the shooting, I choose a spot very rigorously in order to fill my video with different meanings and possibilities for big range of explanations. I also try to do my performances in different towns in order to avoid being tied to a place, and for the possibility of observing the reactions of people in different cultural cells.</p>
                <p>Through the visual selection of the surroundings, I build up the rhythms of people’s movements, traffic and my wheelchair. In this way, through composition and dance, I integrate my body into the environment of the city. Which is impossible in reality, because the wheelchair is what impede freedom of movement in the city, which is usually poorly accessible and designed for body-abled people.</p>
