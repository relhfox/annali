                <p>“Non-action” is a video performance inspired by the video and installation artist Vito Acconci (1940 – 2017). Thinking about his foundational performances, I was trying to determine my own language of working with a camera and creating the provocation similar to his works. It was important for me in terms of my disability and impossibility to move. Therefore I decided not to move at all and use only my glance and the background sound to make my statement.</p>
                <p>I was sitting in my wheelchair without moving, looking into the camera for 16 minutes 33 seconds (maximum length of one video shot). I was trying even not to blink. During the process I didn’t know how long the camera would be shooting and how much time had already passed.</p>
                <p>My eyes began to water on the fourth minute of shooting and on the ninth minute I started to lose the ability to see. My neck started to hurt and the whole process became painful for me. Thus the complete absence of movement caused a strain commensurate with heavy physical activities, which in turn describes the experience of living with a disability.</p>
                <p>The background sound is a documentary about Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock who is famous for his technique which is characterised by putting colours on canvas using expressive motions. In 1952 the American critic Harold Rosenberg invented the term "Action Painting" for Abstract Expressionism and considered canvases as "an arena in which to act". My work is in contrast to this masculine attitude to painting. Instead of using force to create I refuse to act at all and become a picture myself. In the performance I’m trying to find the point in which my immobile video is transforming into a painting.</p>
