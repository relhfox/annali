                <p>The performance “10 sorries” involved the direct participation of the people passing by. I was standing in the narrow street on my wheelchair partially blocking the passage to the street. Each person had to pass sideways through the small space between me and other obstacles.</p>
                <p>During the performance I was saying “I’m sorry” to some people and getting answers from them. It was an expression of the feeling of awkwardness and discomfort when communicating with people. As a disabled person, you often disturb people in the street or scare them away. A wheelchair is like a car, so pedestrians and a wheelchair user try to avoid each other in the streets. Thus you are usually isolated from direct communication.</p>
                <p>I created the situation of almost intimate physical and psychological interaction between me and passers-by. With the help of this I try to investigate the dual pair of anxiety and trust that is undoubtedly present in the relationship between disabled and body-abled people.</p>
